# 👋 Hi, I'm Paula 

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a molecular and cellular biologist turned data scientist, with 20+ years in academic research and fresh expertise in applied data science and machine learning. I combine deep scientific knowledge with modern analytical tools to tackle complex problems—especially in biology and biomedicine—but my passion extends beyond the lab. I'm driven by the power of big data to deliver insights and impact across domains.

## 🧪 Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Here’s a selection of personal, academic, and study-related projects that reflect my journey into applied data science:

- 🧬 [**RNA-seq Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcome Analysis**](https://github.com/paulavazq/Final_Project_RNAseq)  
  * Identified clinical biomarkers using RNA-seq data, applying differential gene expression analysis and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN on tabular data converted to images).

- 🍬🩸 **Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning** *(coming soon)*  
  * Built supervised models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) to predict diabetes risk from women patient health data.*

- 🎵 **Audio Classification with Deep Learning** *(coming soon)*  
  * Developed CNN-based classifier for urban sound datasets classification (audio vs speach) using spectrograms, CNNs, and PyTorch *

- 👁️ 🐶 **Computer Vision Internship Project** *(in progress, private)*  
  *Behavioral tracking of dogs using YOLO and DeepLabCut.*
